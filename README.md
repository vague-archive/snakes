# Void Snakes

This is an example game built with the `@vaguevoid/sdk` of the classic
game "Snakes". You control a snake with the arrow keys (up, down, left, right)
and must eat as much food as possible, growing in length each time, without
crashing into your own snake body.

```bash
> bun install                  # install dependencies
> bun run dev                  # run the game
> bun update @vaguevoid/sdk    # update the sdk
```
